# Uri_paper_MK


**Scripts for generating the figures in Uri's first draft of his manuscript + plots for reviewers' comments**

*FIGURE X* and *Supplementary Extended Data Figure X* notebooks match up with the first draft of Uri's manuscript  

*Reviewer X plots* notebookes match up with the respective reviewer. The notebooks are organized in the same way that the plots on the google drive are organized (meaning if you search for the name of the folder that specific plots are in you'll find the code for those plots in the script)
